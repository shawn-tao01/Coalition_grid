# benchmark.jl — Coalition formation method comparison.
#
# Run:  OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 julia benchmark.jl
#
# OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 is required: SCS uses OpenMP which is slow for these small
# problems and deadlocks with Julia threads. The env var must be set before
# Julia starts (libgomp reads it at process load).
#
# Compares coalition-formation strategies on the same receding-horizon MPC
# problem (same buildings, prices, horizon):
#
#   1. Decentralised         — each building optimises alone (no cooperation)
#   2. Limited-info (non-DP)  — privacy_focussed_coals (deterministic greedy)
#   3. Full-info greedy       — bottom_up_full_info (OFF by default, slow)
#   4. Differential privacy   — privacy_focussed_coals_with_delta (OFF by default)
#
# Methods 3 and 4 are included for reference but disabled by default so
# collaborators who only need non-DP results can run this script as-is.
# Set RUN_FULL_INFO=true or RUN_DP=true at the top to enable them.
